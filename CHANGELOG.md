# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Security

- Build FOSS2 relay transport destinations from operator-approved origins;
  only the path/query comes from the validated request. Existing exact-origin,
  redirect, DNS pinning and private-address checks remain required.
- Return a fixed error code from the loopback SWOP test server, keeping exception
  details in the local test log.
- Refresh FOSS2 `source-map-js` to 1.2.2 and pin Kotlin/JS test-tool dependencies
  `serialize-javascript` to 7.0.5 and `diff` to 8.0.3. Regenerate/install the
  checked-in npm lockfiles before testing. The core wire schema is unchanged.

### Maintenance

- Document contribution/testing rules, security boundaries and partial OpenSSF
  evidence, including the remaining license-scope and legacy parental-PIN
  cryptography questions. No certification or consumer rollout is implied.
